RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka are both message brokers, but they serve different purposes. RabbitMQ is a general-purpose message broker focusing on reliable message delivery,
while Kafka is a distributed streaming platform designed for high-throughput, real-time data processing.
RabbitMQ excels in scenarios requiring flexible routing and reliable message delivery, making it suitable for background tasks, microservices,
and general-purpose messaging. Kafka, on the other hand, is optimized for high-volume data streams, real-time analytics, and building durable event streams,
making it ideal for log aggregation, operational metrics, and real-time data processing. 

Here's a more detailed comparison:

RabbitMQ:
 - Focus: Reliable message delivery, flexible routing, and general-purpose messaging. 
 - Use cases: Background tasks, microservices, order processing, real-time notifications. 
 - Architecture: Message broker with various routing options (direct, fanout, topic, etc.). 
 - Durability: Messages are typically stored in memory, offering good performance but less durability. 
 - Scalability: Scalable but may require more effort for high-volume scenarios. 
 - Messaging protocols: Supports AMQP, MQTT, STOMP. 
 - Security: Offers out-of-the-box authentication (LDAP, OAuth2). 

Kafka: 
 - Focus: High-throughput, low-latency real-time data streaming.
 - Use cases: Log aggregation, operational metrics, real-time data processing, event sourcing.
 - Architecture: Distributed streaming platform with durable storage.
 - Durability: Messages are stored on disk, providing better durability.
 - Scalability: Highly scalable for handling large volumes of data.
 - Messaging protocol: Primarily uses a binary protocol over TCP.
 - Security: Uses JAAS for authentication.

Key Differences:
Data Flow:
    RabbitMQ uses a bounded data flow (producer sends messages to specific consumers), while Kafka uses an unbounded data flow (data streams continuously to topics). 
Storage:
    RabbitMQ primarily uses in-memory storage, while Kafka uses durable, log-based storage. 
Scalability:
    Kafka is designed for high scalability, while RabbitMQ can be scaled but requires more effort for large deployments. 
Latency:
    Kafka offers low latency, while RabbitMQ has slightly higher latency. 
Use Cases:
    RabbitMQ is suitable for general messaging and task queues, while Kafka is optimized for real-time data streams and analytics.
